Within this scheme, field commutators at separated points can be evaluated in terms of \"bare\" field creation and annihilation operators. This allows for keeping track of the time-evolution of both the \"bare\" and \"renormalized\", or perturbed, values of the Hamiltonian and expresses everything in terms of the coupled, gauge invariant \"bare\" field-equations.
